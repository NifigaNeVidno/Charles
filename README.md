## Download

You can clone the repository and build Charles yourself or you can simply [grab the latest version on the releases page](https://github.com/simonbs/Charles/releases).

Note that if you choose to compile Charles yourself, you must enter your own API key in Constants.h. You can obtain an API key from [TheTVDB.com](http://thetvdb.com).

## Usage

Using Charles is really simple. First you need your video files and subtitle files - or even just one of the two. Charles doesn't really care if he gets both video and subtitle files or even if he gets a subtitle for each video and vice versa.

Open up Charles and search for the TV series that you have video and/or subtitle files for. Select the correct search result and the correct season.
Load your video and subtitle files into Charles either one by one in the table showing the episodes or by pressing either the "Select video folder" or "Select subtitle folder" button. This allows you to select an entire folder with the files in and Charles will then try to match your files with an episode.

Select the output directory where Charles will move your renamed files to.
Make sure that everything is configured as you want to and press the "Go!" button. Your files should now be named correctly!

**NOTE**: I'm still teaching Charles some new tricks which will make him even more helpful. However, I think he does a pretty good job already.
